# marcusrbrown/marcusrbrown.github.io

> **Superseded by [[marcusrbrown--marcusrbrown-com]] (2026-07-13).** The brand site this page documents was **renamed** `marcusrbrown/marcusrbrown.github.io` → `marcusrbrown/marcusrbrown.com` (same repo id `1021912280`, created 2025-07-18; issue set #411/#409/#260/#6 carried forward). All survey history below (2026-04-25 → 2026-06-23) is the marcusrbrown.com brand site under its former name. **Name-collision warning:** a *different* repo (id `1174807412`, created 2026-03-06, homepage **mrbro.dev**) now occupies the `marcusrbrown/marcusrbrown.github.io` name as the Pages holder for [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]] — it is unrelated to this brand site. The `marcusrbrown.com` alias below is therefore retired here; see the canonical page for current state.

Personal brand site for Marcus R. Brown. Single-page React 19 portfolio deployed to [[github-pages]] at [marcusrbrown.com](https://marcusrbrown.com). Simpler than [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]] (the full developer portfolio at mrbro.dev) — no routing, no theme system, no blog. Four anchor-linked sections: About, Experience, Skills, Contact.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Workflows

| Workflow | File | Trigger | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CI | `ci.yaml` | PR to `main`, dispatch | Lint, build, test, type-check, dependency audit, quality gate |
| Deploy | `deploy.yaml` | push to `main`, dispatch | Lint, build, deploy to GitHub Pages (marcusrbrown.com) |
| Fro Bot | `fro-bot.yaml` | PR, issue, comment, schedule, dispatch | PR review, daily maintenance, @fro-bot mentions |
| Renovate | `renovate.yaml` | issue/PR edit, push to non-main, dispatch, workflow_run | Dependency management via `bfra-me/.github` reusable workflow |
| Copilot Setup Steps | `copilot-setup-steps.yaml` | dispatch, push/PR touching workflow | Copilot agent environment verification |

### CI Quality Gate (ci.yaml)

Six parallel jobs after shared setup: Lint (ESLint + formatting check), Build (with dist output verification), Test (Vitest), Type Check (`tsc --noEmit`), Validate Dependencies (`pnpm audit`). A `quality-gate` aggregation job posts a PR comment on pass. Uses a GitHub App token (`APPLICATION_ID`/`APPLICATION_PRIVATE_KEY`) for the PR comment step.

### Deploy Pipeline (deploy.yaml)

Sequential: checkout, setup, lint, build, upload pages artifact (`./dist`), deploy via `actions/deploy-pages`. Requires `pages: write` and `id-token: write` permissions. Concurrency group `pages` with `cancel-in-progress: false`.

### Shared Setup Action

`.github/actions/setup/` — reusable composite action. Handles pnpm install (via `pnpm/action-setup@v6.0.3`), Node.js 22 (via `actions/setup-node@v6.4.0`), optional Playwright browser install with caching. Used across all workflows.

## Fro Bot Integration

**Fro Bot workflow is present and active** (`fro-bot/agent@v0.61.0`, SHA `6794bf595059d0419d31abf027cfcf66ff0780ec`, as of 2026-06-12 survey; was v0.48.1 / `80f1fa11…` at 2026-06-01 and v0.44.0 / `b030b53b…` at 2026-05-18).

- **Triggers:** PR events (opened, synchronize, ready_for_review, reopened, review_requested), issue/comment events (`@fro-bot` mention from OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR), two daily crons (autoheal at 03:30 UTC, maintenance at 15:30 UTC), manual dispatch with `mode` input.
- **Single-file three-mode design:** Unlike [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]] and [[marcusrbrown--vbs]] (which split `fro-bot.yaml` + `fro-bot-autoheal.yaml`), this repo runs review, maintenance, and autoheal modes from one workflow file dispatched by event + `inputs.mode`. Cron schedule disambiguated via `AUTOHEAL_CRON` / `MAINTENANCE_CRON` env vars.
- **PR review prompt:** Structured review targeting React 19 patterns, TypeScript strictness, pure ESM, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), performance budgets (JS <500KB warning, total <2MB max), PascalCase hooks, `.yaml` extension convention. Verdict format: PASS / CONDITIONAL / REJECT with blocking/non-blocking/missing tests/risk sections.
- **Maintenance prompt:** Perpetual single-issue hygiene model with archive logic and cross-project intelligence ingestion (post-2026-05-14 redesign).
- **Autoheal prompt (8 categories):** Errored PRs, Security, Code Quality & Repo Hygiene, Developer Experience, Production Site Review, Quality Gates Verification, Cross-Project Intelligence (Inbound), Upstream Modernization Watch (Sundays UTC only). Sunday detection uses a step output rather than `GITHUB_ENV` (Copilot review feedback, PR #407). Playwright browsers conditionally installed when `mode == autoheal`.
- **Fork PR guard:** Skips bot-authored and fork PRs. Issue_comment fork detection via API call. Whitespace-only `prompt` inputs rejected in review mode (PR #407 hardening).
- **Permissions:** Moved to job level and expanded for autoheal write operations.
- **Concurrency:** Per-issue/PR for events; per-schedule (`ops-{cron}`) for scheduled runs; per-mode for dispatched runs. Non-cancelling.

## Developer Tooling

- **Renovate:** Extends `marcusrbrown/renovate-config#5.2.1` (as of 2026-06-12; was `#4.5.8` at initial survey, `#5.2.0` after PR #406) + `:preserveSemverRanges` + `group:allNonMajor`. Post-upgrade: `pnpm install`, `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run fix` (twice). Uses `bfra-me/.github` reusable workflow (v4.16.25 as of 2026-06-12). Trigger model: issue/PR edit (non-bot), push to non-main, dispatch, workflow_run after Deploy.
- **Git Hooks:** `simple-git-hooks` with `lint-staged` running `eslint --fix` on staged files.
- **AGENTS.md:** Comprehensive root-level file with code map, conventions, commands, CI table, testing guide, anti-patterns. Generated 2026-03-10.
- **Copilot instructions:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with stack summary and critical conventions (PascalCase hooks, strict TS, named exports, `.yaml` extension).
- **AI planning:** `.ai/plan/` directory for feature implementation plans.
- **pnpm workspace:** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` present with security overrides (`flatted`, `ajv`, `brace-expansion`, etc.) and `shamefullyHoist: true`.

## Notable Patterns and Conventions

- **PascalCase hook files:** `UseScrollReveal.ts` not `useScrollReveal.ts` — same convention as [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]]
- **No routing:** Single-page with anchor links, no React Router
- **No default exports:** Named exports only, enforced via AGENTS.md
- **No enums:** `erasableSyntaxOnly` — use `as const` unions
- **Pure ESM:** No CommonJS `require()` or `module.exports`
- **ESLint flat config:** `eslint.config.ts` extending `@bfra.me/eslint-config` with React and Vitest support. Markdown virtual files excluded from type-aware rules (tracked in issue #265).
- **SWC over Babel:** `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` for compilation
- **Inline Vitest config:** Test config lives inside `vite.config.ts`, no separate vitest.config
- **Accessibility-first:** `vitest-axe` matchers in test setup for `toHaveNoViolations()` assertions

## Missing Compared to Other Marcus Repos

_Updated 2026-05-18: two gaps closed, two remain._

- **No Probot `settings.yml`:** Still true. Unlike [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]], [[marcusrbrown--ha-config]], and most other Marcus repos, this repo does not have a `.github/settings.yml` extending `fro-bot/.github:common-settings.yaml`. Branch protection and repo settings are not managed via Probot.
- **No CodeQL/Scorecard:** Still true. No security scanning workflows (present in [[marcusrbrown--systematic]] and [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]]).
- ~~No autoheal workflow~~ — **Closed 2026-05-14 (PR #407).** Autoheal integrated as a mode in `fro-bot.yaml` with 8 healing categories rather than as a separate `fro-bot-autoheal.yaml` file. Architecturally distinct from the sibling-repo pattern.
- ~~No performance workflow~~ — **Partially closed.** `lhci.config.js` is now present at the repo root, but no dedicated Lighthouse CI workflow has been added. Likely invoked from the CI quality gate or the autoheal "Production Site Review" / "Quality Gates Verification" categories.

## Relationship to mrbro.dev

This repo and [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]] both deploy React+Vite sites to GitHub Pages, but serve different purposes:

| Aspect | marcusrbrown.github.io | mrbro.dev |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain | marcusrbrown.com | mrbro.dev |
| Scope | Single-page brand landing | Full portfolio + blog + projects |
| Routing | None (anchor links) | React Router v7 |
| Theme system | None | 10+ presets, custom creator, JSON schema validation |
| Content source | Static | GitHub API (dynamic blog/projects) |
| Test layers | Unit + E2E + A11y | Unit + E2E + Visual regression + A11y + Lighthouse |
| Autoheal | Integrated as mode in `fro-bot.yaml` (8 categories) | Separate `fro-bot-autoheal.yaml` (5 categories) |
| Fro Bot agent version | v0.61.0 (2026-06-12) | v0.43.0 at last survey (likely behind) |

A curiosity surfaced 2026-06-12: this repo's `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` opens with "branch protection rules… for the **mrbro.dev** project" — the doc was evidently ported from [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]] without renaming the project reference. Harmless, but it confirms the cross-repo doc-porting pattern (and that nobody proofread the header).

## Delta Log (2026-05-18, SHA `4cd8198`)

Material changes since the 2026-04-25 survey at `ec4b785`. The site's structure and tech stack are unchanged; the interesting motion is in CI/CD and the Fro Bot integration.

- **Fro Bot agent bumped four times in three weeks:** v0.41.4 → v0.42.6 (PR #400) → v0.42.7 (#402) → v0.43.0 (#407) → v0.43.1 (#412) → v0.43.2 (#414) → v0.43.3 (#415) → **v0.44.0** (current on `main`, pinned via SHA `b030b53b1b47b1bed77a581222706c900cc63b0e`). PR #417 is in flight to v0.44.1 (open as of 2026-05-20). Tracks the agent release cadence aggressively — same posture as [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]] and [[marcusrbrown--gpt]].
- **Autoheal collapsed into the Fro Bot workflow itself (PR #407, 2026-05-14):** The earlier "no autoheal" gap noted in the prior survey was closed by integrating autoheal as a second cron (`30 3 * * *`) and a `workflow_dispatch` `mode` input (`review` / `maintenance` / `autoheal`, default `autoheal`) inside the existing `fro-bot.yaml` — not by adding a separate `fro-bot-autoheal.yaml` like the sibling repos. One file, three modes, branched by event + input.
- **Autoheal prompt has 8 categories** (vs. 5 in [[marcusrbrown--vbs]] and [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]]): 1) Errored PRs, 2) Security, 3) Code Quality & Repo Hygiene, 4) Developer Experience, 5) Production Site Review, 6) Quality Gates Verification, 7) Cross-Project Intelligence (Inbound), 8) Upstream Modernization Watch (Sundays UTC only — `IS_SUNDAY_UTC` propagated via step output, not `GITHUB_ENV`).
- **Maintenance prompt now perpetual-single-issue:** Rolling 14-day window collapsed into a perpetual maintenance issue with archive logic and cross-project intelligence ingestion.
- **Renovate preset jumped major version:** `marcusrbrown/renovate-config#4.5.8` → `#5.2.0` (PR #406, 2026-05-16). Same upgrade inadvertently dropped the `fast-uri` security override, which would have flagged GHSA-q3j6-qgpj-74h6 and GHSA-v39h-62p7-jpjc — the override was restored in the same PR (and again hardened in #408). `package.json` now carries an explicit `pnpm.overrides.fast-uri: ">=3.1.2"` and `flatted: ">=3.4.2"`. Worth tracking — the v5 preset has different defaults that need vetting per repo.
- **`bfra-me/.github` reusable workflows:** v4.16.8 → v4.16.12 (#401) → v4.16.17 (#413).
- **New file: `lhci.config.js` (3326 bytes)** at root. Lighthouse CI configuration is now present, closing the "no performance workflow" gap noted in the prior survey — though no Lighthouse workflow file was added; the config likely runs from the CI quality gate or the autoheal "Production Site Review" category.
- **New file: `TESTING.md` (15440 bytes)** at root. Dedicated testing documentation, separate from AGENTS.md.
- **New script: `analyze-build`** in `package.json` (PR #410) — `tsx scripts/analyze-build.ts`. Bundle-analysis tooling, consistent with the "Performance budget adherence" line in the PR review prompt.
- **Dependency bumps:** pnpm `10.33.0` → `10.33.4` (#404), `@types/node` to `^24.0.0`, all other non-major bumps grouped via Renovate.
- **Open issues:** 2 → 4 (added `#409` Daily Autohealing Report and `#411` test branch coverage below 80% — the autoheal is doing its job).
- **PR #410** confirms `fro-bot` (account `80104189`) co-authored a security-fix commit alongside the bot account — first observed instance of Fro Bot directly committing to this repo.

### Implications

The earlier survey's "Missing Compared to Other Marcus Repos" section is partially obsolete:

- ~~No autoheal workflow~~ → **integrated into `fro-bot.yaml`** as a mode, not a separate file. Architecturally distinct from the sibling-repo pattern.
- ~~No performance workflow~~ → **`lhci.config.js` present**, no dedicated workflow yet.
- **No Probot `settings.yml`** — still true, branch protection remains unmanaged via Probot.
- **No CodeQL/Scorecard** — still true.

## Delta Log (2026-06-01, SHA `1a428e2`)

No structural drift since the 2026-05-20 re-survey at `4cd8198`. Twelve days, eleven commits — all Renovate dependency bumps and lockfile maintenance, no architecture changes. The stack, workflow inventory, single-file three-mode Fro Bot design, and crons are unchanged.

- **Fro Bot agent climbed v0.44.0 → v0.48.1 across six bumps:** v0.44.1 (#417, 2026-05-25) → v0.46.0 (#420) → v0.46.1 (#421) → v0.48.0 (#424, 2026-05-31). The pin on `main` now reads `fro-bot/agent@80f1fa11d8e25280d388947c0a28875ed18cdc25 # v0.48.1` — newer than the v0.48.0 of commit #424, folded in with the non-major batch #425 (2026-06-01). Same aggressive release-tracking posture as [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]] and [[marcusrbrown--gpt]]. The PR #417 that was "in flight" at the 2026-05-20 survey has long since merged.
- **pnpm:** `10.33.4` → `10.34.1` (#423). `packageManager: pnpm@10.34.1` confirmed.
- **`bfra-me/.github` reusable workflows:** v4.16.17 → v4.16.21 (#419).
- **Core stack unchanged:** React `^19.0.0`, TypeScript `^6.0.0`, Vite `^7.0.6`, Vitest `^4.0.0`, `@types/node ^24.0.0`. Security overrides `fast-uri >=3.1.2` and `flatted >=3.4.2` still present in `pnpm.overrides`.
- **Workflow inventory steady:** `ci.yaml`, `copilot-setup-steps.yaml`, `deploy.yaml`, `fro-bot.yaml`, `renovate.yaml`. Crons unchanged (`AUTOHEAL_CRON 30 3 * * *`, `MAINTENANCE_CRON 30 15 * * *`).
- **Open issues:** steady at 4 (#411, #409, #260, #6). **Open PRs:** 0.
- The two long-standing gaps still hold: **no Probot `settings.yml`**, **no CodeQL/Scorecard**. No contradictions with prior ingests.

## Delta Log (2026-06-12, SHA `b633e40`)

Eleven days, 27 commits since `1a428e2` — every one a Renovate bump touching only `.github/renovate.json5` and the five workflow files (plus lockfile). Zero structural drift: stack, workflow inventory, single-file three-mode Fro Bot design, and crons (`30 3` autoheal / `30 15` maintenance UTC) all unchanged. This repo is in pure autopilot cruise.

- **Fro Bot agent climbed v0.48.1 → v0.61.0 across ~16 bumps** (#433–#452, near-daily merges; v0.53.0/.1, v0.54.x, v0.55.x ×5, v0.56.x, v0.57.0, v0.58.0, v0.59.x, v0.60.0, v0.61.0). Pin on `main`: `fro-bot/agent@6794bf595059d0419d31abf027cfcf66ff0780ec # v0.61.0`. That's *ahead* of [[bfra-me--renovate-action]] (v0.60.0, previously the ecosystem version leader) — this repo is now the canary.
- **Renovate preset:** `marcusrbrown/renovate-config#5.2.0` → `#5.2.1` in `.github/renovate.json5`.
- **`bfra-me/.github` reusable workflows:** v4.16.21 → v4.16.25 (#446, #451).
- **Security-override migration to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:** the workspace file now carries ~12 GHSA-style overrides (`ajv`, `brace-expansion`, `rollup`, `qs`, `minimatch`, `picomatch`, etc.) plus `onlyBuiltDependencies` and `shamefullyHoist: true`. `package.json` still retains the legacy `pnpm.overrides` for `fast-uri >=3.1.2` and `flatted >=3.4.2` — split-brain override management, mirroring the pattern [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]] adopted (~20 entries there). Worth consolidating into one location eventually.
- **GitHub repo `homepage` field is now null** (was https://marcusrbrown.com in earlier surveys). The site domain still lives in `package.json`. Minor metadata regression, possibly from a Probot-less settings drift — consistent with the long-standing "no Probot `settings.yml`" gap.
- **Co-author shift:** recent Renovate merges are co-authored by `mrbro-bot[bot]` — the same new bot identity first observed in [[marcusrbrown--ha-config]]. The bot migration is spreading across the fleet.
- **Open issues steady at 4** (#411, #409, #260, #6); 0 open PRs. Issue #411 (branch coverage <80%) has now sat open since mid-May — autoheal files reports but hasn't closed the coverage gap.
- The two long-standing gaps still hold: **no Probot `settings.yml`**, **no CodeQL/Scorecard**. No contradictions with prior ingests.

## Delta Log (2026-06-23, SHA `b633e40` — no-op re-survey)

`main` HEAD is *still* `b633e40` — eleven days on, the same SHA as the 2026-06-12 survey. The default-branch ref hasn't advanced; the Fro Bot agent pin reads `fro-bot/agent@6794bf595059d0419d31abf027cfcf66ff0780ec # v0.61.0`, unchanged. Stack, workflow inventory (`ci.yaml`, `copilot-setup-steps.yaml`, `deploy.yaml`, `fro-bot.yaml`, `renovate.yaml`), single-file three-mode design, and crons all hold. No structural drift, no contradictions with prior ingests.

The motion has moved off `main` and onto the staging lane — two open Renovate PRs, both based on `main`, neither yet merged:

- **PR #454 — `chore(dev): update dependency vite to v7.3.5 [SECURITY]`** (branch `renovate/npm-vite-vulnerability`, opened 2026-06-15). A flagged-security bump that has sat open ~8 days. Worth watching: this repo normally automerges Renovate within hours, so a security PR lingering over a week is a small smell — either the quality gate is red or automerge isn't matching the security branch pattern. The earlier survey flagged issue #411 (branch coverage <80%) blocking the gate; a coverage-failing `main` would explain a stuck security PR.
- **PR #453 — `chore(deps): update all non-major dependencies`** (branch `renovate/all-minor-patch`, opened 2026-06-13). The rolling non-major batch, also unmerged ~10 days.

- **`pushed_at` advanced to 2026-06-22** despite a frozen `main` — consistent with ongoing pushes to the two Renovate branches, not to the trunk.
- **GitHub `open_issues_count` reads 6** (vs. 4 tracked issues #411/#409/#260/#6) because the API count folds in the 2 open PRs. Issue inventory itself is steady at 4.
- **Stars/watchers ticked 0 → 1.** Cosmetic.
- The two long-standing gaps still hold: **no Probot `settings.yml`**, **no CodeQL/Scorecard**.

The autopilot is still cruising, but the security PR stalling for over a week is the first sign the automerge daemon may be choking on a red gate. If #411's coverage floor is what's holding it, the autoheal that *files* the coverage report still isn't *closing* the loop — the report-without-remediation pattern noted at 2026-06-12 now has a concrete cost: a security fix held hostage to a coverage threshold.

## Delta Log (2026-07-20, SHA `4bdbf32` — name now resolves to the mrbro.dev repo)

A survey dispatched against the *name* `marcusrbrown/marcusrbrown.github.io` no longer lands on the brand site this page originally documented. The GitHub name now resolves to repo **id `1174807412`** — the exact "name-collision" repo the 2026-07-13 header warned about. That repo is the **mrbro.dev developer portfolio**, canonically documented at **[[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]]**. The brand-site content (former repo id `1021912280`) lives on at [[marcusrbrown--marcusrbrown-com]] under its renamed name `marcusrbrown/marcusrbrown.com`. This section records the current occupant's snapshot so the collision is empirically confirmed; the durable per-repo knowledge belongs on the [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]] page, not here.

**Confirmed identity of the current name-holder (`4bdbf32`, `feat(opencode): add Impeccable edit feedback (#208)`, 2026-07-19):**

- **Repo id:** `1174807412` (created 2026-03-06) — *not* the brand-site id `1021912280`. Distinct repo, same name.
- **Homepage:** `http://mrbro.dev/`. **`package.json` `name`:** `mrbro.dev`. **Description:** "My portfolio." **Topics:** `blog, developer, github-pages, portfolio, react, typescript, vite`.
- **Scope markers that distinguish it from the brand site:** React Router v7 (`react-router-dom ^7.15.0`), a prerendered blog + RSS pipeline (`feed`, `shiki`, `unified`/`remark`/`rehype` chain, `scripts/prerender-blog.ts`, `blog-refresh.yaml`), visual-regression + accessibility + performance test tiers (Playwright projects, `lhci` mobile/desktop, `performance.yaml`, `e2e-tests.yaml`), and an `.impeccable/` design gate with `DESIGN.md` / `PRODUCT.md`. This is the full portfolio, not the four-section anchor-link landing page.
- **Stack:** React 19, TypeScript **5.9.3** (note: *not* v6 — the brand site was on TS 6), Vite 7.3.6, Vitest 4.1.10, Playwright 1.61.1, `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`, pnpm `10.33.4` (`engines.pnpm ^10.28.2`), Node `>=22.6.0`. License MIT (declared in `package.json`; API `license` reads null — no LICENSE file).
- **Split-brain security overrides:** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` carries ~20 GHSA-annotated entries (`brace-expansion`, `fast-uri`, `qs`, `ws`, `tmp`, `rollup`, `minimatch`, `picomatch`, `ajv`, `mdast-util-to-hast`, `yauzl`, etc.) while `package.json` `pnpm.overrides` retains `js-yaml`/`qs`/`tmp`/`uuid` — same override-ledger pattern documented on [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]].
- **Workflows (8):** `ci.yaml`, `deploy.yaml`, `fro-bot.yaml`, `renovate.yaml`, `blog-refresh.yaml`, `e2e-tests.yaml`, `performance.yaml`, `copilot-setup-steps.yaml`. Deploy is push-to-`main` → lint → test → build (`GITHUB_PAGES=true`) → `actions/deploy-pages`, concurrency group `pages`.
- **Fro Bot workflow is present and active** — `fro-bot/agent@a4976f45a51458c349eb232aa1795f6fa25d5500 # v0.93.1`, single-file three-mode (review/maintenance/autoheal) with crons `30 3` autoheal / `30 15` maintenance UTC. Adds a `discussion_comment` trigger beyond the brand site's event set. PR-review prompt is explicitly scoped to "mrbro.dev — a React 19+ / TypeScript / Vite 7+ portfolio." **No onboarding follow-up draft PR is warranted for this name.**
- **Renovate:** extends `marcusrbrown/renovate-config#5.2.7` + `group:allNonMajor`; post-upgrade `pnpm install` → `build` → `fix` ×2.
- **Open issues (4):** #204 (bug: restore missing project preview image), #162 (Daily Autohealing Report), #13 (Daily Maintenance Report), #1 (Dependency Dashboard). Stars 1. These belong to the mrbro.dev repo, not the brand-site issue set (#411/#409/#260/#6) tracked in earlier sections above.

**Contradiction note (does not overwrite prior records):** All survey rows above dated 2026-04-25 → 2026-06-23 describe the *brand site* (repo id `1021912280`) under its former name. From 2026-07-20 forward, a survey of this *name* observes the *mrbro.dev repo* (id `1174807412`) instead. The name-to-repo binding flipped; the prior content is preserved as the historical record of what the name pointed to before the rename. For live mrbro.dev state, defer to [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]] (whose own frontmatter already lists this name in `related` and notes the `repository.url` mismatch pointing back here).

| 2026-05-19 | `4cd8198` | No-op re-survey: HEAD unchanged since 2026-05-18. Open issues steady at 4 (#411, #409, #260, #6), 0 open PRs. Fro Bot agent pin verified at `b030b53b...` (v0.44.0). All prior findings hold. |
| 2026-05-20 | `4cd8198` | No-op re-survey: HEAD still unchanged. Renovate PR #417 (fro-bot/agent v0.44.0 → v0.44.1, branch `renovate/all-minor-patch`) is open and will likely merge under `:automergePatch`. Open issues steady at 4 (#411, #409, #260, #6); open PRs now 1 (#417). `package.json` confirms `packageManager: pnpm@10.33.4`, `@types/node ^24.0.0`, React 19 / TypeScript ^6.0.0 / Vite ^7.0.6 / Vitest ^4.0.0 stack unchanged. No structural drift since 2026-05-18. |
| 2026-06-01 | `1a428e2` | Dependency-drift re-survey: HEAD advanced 11 commits, all Renovate bumps. Fro Bot agent v0.44.0 → v0.48.1 (pin `80f1fa11…`), pnpm 10.33.4 → 10.34.1 (#423), `bfra-me/.github` v4.16.17 → v4.16.21 (#419). No structural change to stack, workflows, crons, or Fro Bot single-file three-mode design. Open issues steady at 4; 0 open PRs. Gaps (no Probot `settings.yml`, no CodeQL/Scorecard) unchanged. |
| 2026-06-12 | `b633e40` | Dependency-drift re-survey: 27 commits, all Renovate. Fro Bot agent v0.48.1 → **v0.61.0** (pin `6794bf5…`) — now ecosystem version leader. Renovate preset 5.2.0 → 5.2.1, `bfra-me/.github` → v4.16.25. Security overrides split between `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (~12 entries) and legacy `package.json` `pnpm.overrides` (2 entries). `mrbro-bot[bot]` co-authoring merges. Repo `homepage` field now null. Issues steady at 4; 0 open PRs. Gaps unchanged. |
| 2026-06-23 | `b633e40` | No-op re-survey: `main` HEAD unchanged for 11 days, agent pin still v0.61.0 (`6794bf5…`). All structure/stack/workflows/crons hold. Motion is two unmerged Renovate PRs based on `main`: **#454** (vite v7.3.5 SECURITY, open ~8 days) and **#453** (all-minor-patch, ~10 days). Security PR stalling >1 week suggests automerge choking on a red quality gate — likely issue #411's <80% coverage floor. `pushed_at` 2026-06-22 (PR-branch pushes, not trunk); stars 0→1; issues steady at 4. Gaps (no Probot `settings.yml`, no CodeQL/Scorecard) unchanged. |
| 2026-07-20 | `4bdbf32` | **Name-binding flip confirmed empirically.** A survey of the *name* `marcusrbrown/marcusrbrown.github.io` now resolves to repo id `1174807412` (the mrbro.dev developer portfolio, canonical page [[marcusrbrown--mrbro-dev]]) — not the brand site (id `1021912280`, now [[marcusrbrown--marcusrbrown-com]]). Current occupant: React 19 / TS 5.9.3 / Vite 7.3.6, React Router v7, prerendered blog+RSS, visual/a11y/perf test tiers, `.impeccable` design gate, 8 workflows, Fro Bot present at agent **v0.93.1** (`a4976f4`), Renovate preset #5.2.7, pnpm 10.33.4, MIT. Open issues 4 (#204/#162/#13/#1), stars 1. No onboarding follow-up needed (workflow active). See Delta Log 2026-07-20 for full snapshot. |
